# Hearts-Of-Iron-4-Nuclear-Aftermath
The Fallout mod for Hearts of Iron 4

This is the repository for Nuclear Aftermath. After working on the mod for a week, I have realised I have bit of more then I can chew. Any contributions to this mod will be amazing and will help me release the mod sooner. If you do contrinute, you will be credited (if your contribution is used).

Rules:

-Use the trello board to find out what to do. The trello board has everything that needs working on, and only un-ticked things on the board will be accepted.

-Dont contribute unrelated things, they wont be palced into the mod.

-Don't get angry if your contrinution isn't used, its probably because either I or somebody else has already done it.
